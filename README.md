# SQL-Challenge

In this challenge I used the PG Admin to create tables and do the necessary data analysis.
I have also created an Entity Relationshio Diagram (ERD)

Below is the data analysis that I conducted on PG Admin -

Listed the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

Listed the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

Listed the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

Listed the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

Listed first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

Listed each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

Listed each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

Listed the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
